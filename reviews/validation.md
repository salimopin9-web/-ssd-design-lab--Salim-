Syntax check (choose your tool):
• PlantUML: ensure no syntax errors (editor shows errors live).
• diagrams.net: ensure arrows/head types match the relationship.
Naming consistency:
• The class names in Class diagram appear in use-case narrative (e.g., “Student registers
Course”).
• Associations have multiplicities (e.g., Student 1..* Course if applicable).
Traceability mini-checklist:
• Each use case can be mapped to at least one class responsibility.
• If you mention a “Register Course” flow, you have a class that performs that responsibility.
